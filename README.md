# FlightAnalyzer

## Instructions ##

1) clone repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tumbili/FlightAnalyzer.git
    
2) add the path to the python script to your PATH environment variable, e.g.
add the following to you .bashrc file:

    $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/repo/location
    
3) update the PATH variable

    $ source ~/.bashrc
    
Now you should be able to call the script globally und provide it the path to the logfile as first argument, e.g.:

    $ plot_maneuver_quad.py /path/to/log/file
    
You can use the terminal with which you have started the script to give commands to the script. Type 'help' to find out what commands are available.
